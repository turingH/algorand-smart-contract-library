# Verified Knowledge - RateLimiter Overflow Analysis

The following aspects of `contracts/library/RateLimiter.py` have been audited and confirmed as safe. Future audit plans can skip re-validating these points unless code changes are introduced.

1. `_update_capacity()` uses `ARC4UInt256` and `ARC4UInt64` types which are safe for 256-bit and 64-bit operations.
2. Multiplication `(limit * time_delta)` relies on algopy `BigUInt` operations which handle up to 512-bit results, preventing overflow when `limit` and `time_delta` are at their maximums.
3. Division by `duration` ensures the result cannot exceed `limit * time_delta`, and the final capacity is clamped to `limit`.
4. Existing tests (`tests/library/RateLimiter.test.ts`) exercise extreme values (e.g., `MAX_UINT256` and `MAX_INT64`) and pass without overflow errors.
5. The function contains logical guards such as early return on zero duration and capping capacity to `limit`.
6. All entry points that call `_update_capacity()` first verify bucket existence through `_get_bucket()`.
7. No numeric overflow vulnerabilities were found under current implementation and type guarantees.
